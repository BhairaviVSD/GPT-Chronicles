# GPT Chronicles: Redefining Creative Writing

Generatively Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models, inspired by the paper "Attention is All You Need" and exemplified by OpenAI’s GPT-2 and GPT-3, have gained significant attention for their ability to generate natural language text. However, their potential for aiding creative writing tasks remains underexplored. This project seeks to bridge this gap by investigating how GPT models can be tailored to support creative writing, such as generating stories, poems, or dialogues, taking inspiration from Andrej Karpathy's video ["Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=180s).
